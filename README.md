In closing:

    My website contains four different .html pages, and it is possible to get from any page on my website to any other page by following the hyperlinks.
    My website includes one ordered list, one table, and two images.
    My website has three stylesheet files.
    My stylesheets use over five different CSS properties, and over five different types of CSS selectors. I used the #id selector, and the .class selector more than once.
    My stylesheets include two mobile-responsive @media queries, which changes the background clolor when the screen is a smaller size.
    I used Bootstrap 4, and took advantage of the Nav Bootstrap component, and I used two Bootstrap columns for layout purposes using Bootstrapâ€™s grid model.
    My stylesheets use one SCSS variable, contains one example of SCSS nesting, and one use of SCSS inheritance.
    And this is my README.md file.
